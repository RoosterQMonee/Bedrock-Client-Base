> Im not the best programmer, so beware of any low-quality code or practices!

> This base is designed for **1.21.30.X**, but updating any signatures, offsets, or structures should work.

> If you want to use the logging tools in this base, you will need special permissions to allocate a console (see [Jiayi Launcher](https://github.com/JiayiSoftware/JiayiLauncher))
